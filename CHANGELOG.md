# Oracle Portfolio Manager — CHANGELOG

## Changelog Format Standard *(Added 2025-10-25)*

**Framework:** The Options Oracle Methodology
**Author:** Edward Corona

All entries follow a consistent developer-oriented structure for automated parsing and release documentation:

```
## Version X.Y — Month Year
### Highlights
- Key feature additions and user-visible improvements.

### Technical Improvements
- Developer-focused, refactor, or CI/CD changes.
```

Future roadmap entries use the format:
```
## Version 6.0 and Beyond — Planned Roadmap
```

---

## Version 5.0 — October 2025

### Highlights
- Full project refactor into modular `/src/`, `/data/`, `/docs/`, and `/tests/` structure.
- Auto-calibration logic for roll, take-profit, and delta thresholds (based on entry IV and DTE).
- Profit vs IV analysis and volatility-band evaluation.
- Makefile with developer commands (`setup`, `run`, `test`, `clean`, `info`).
- `setup_project.sh` for environment setup and reproducible builds.
- Pytest-based testing under `/tests/`.
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) for automated validation on push/PR.
- Developer documentation: `README.md`, `index.md`, `oracle_rules.md`, `folder_structure.md`.
- Risk-free rate override (3‑month T‑bill default) with CLI `--rate`.
- Sample `portfolio.csv` (MSTR example) for quick start.
- Added compatibility aliases `make run-v5` and `make demo-v5` to preserve backward compatibility with older automation workflows *(maintained through v6)*.

### Technical Improvements
- Consolidated configuration in `config/config.json`.
- Added `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` for environment hygiene.
- Test coverage for IV compression, auto-calibration tiers, rule 6 actions, and capital-at-risk fallbacks.
- Makefile compatibility verified for legacy automation scripts (`run-v5`, `demo-v5`).

## Version 4.0 — September 2025

### Highlights
- Visual profit vs IV curve plotting.
- DTE logic refinement for long-dated options (180+ DTE modifier).
- Risk-free rate assumption and IV compression rules (experimental Rule 7 refinements).
- Improved report formatting (aligned console bands and color codes).

### Technical Improvements
- Refactored evaluation pipeline for extensibility.
- Improved CLI parsing and error handling.

---

## Version 3.0 — July 2025

### Highlights
- Modularized main evaluation script and enhanced logging.
- Timestamped CSV and Excel exports.
- DTE ≤ 75 management logic and IV band thresholds.
- Portfolio ROC and annualized yield calculations.

### Technical Improvements
- Introduced reusable helpers for risk and IV math.

---

## Version 2.0 — May 2025

### Highlights
- Formalized rule-based analysis (Rules 1–6).
- Live delta, DTE, and ROC evaluation.
- Portfolio-level aggregation metrics.

### Technical Improvements
- CLI interface and basic project scaffolding.

---

## Version 1.0 — February 2025

### Highlights
- Initial prototype for Oracle Portfolio Manager.
- Basic short put evaluation engine and manual decision framework.
- Single-position logic (no auto-calibration).

### Technical Improvements

---

## Version 6.0 and Beyond — Planned Roadmap

### Highlights (Planned)
- Broker Integrations: Interactive Brokers (IBKR), Tradier, and TastyTrade APIs.
- Alert System: Slack and Telegram notifications for rule breaches (IV expansion, delta breach, DTE trigger).
- Analytics Dashboard: Interactive web dashboard using Plotly or Streamlit for ROC and IV curve visualization.
- Database Archiving: Historical trade log storage (SQLite/PostgreSQL backend).
- Automation Engine: Scheduled nightly runs via cron or cloud function.
- Enhanced CI/CD: Test matrix expansion with code coverage reports.
- Machine Learning Extensions: IV regime clustering and trade outcome prediction models.
